In equation (20) we obtain a solution for the matrix of optimum weighting coefficients in terms of certain "population moments" of the ordinates of the curve. Explicit formulae based on special assumptions are deduced in equations (34), (56)-(58).

	abstract = {Abstract
            A popular prior choice for Bayesian analysis of high‐dimensional regression models is the global–local family of Gaussian scale‐mixture priors. These priors can be seen as alternatives to the more classical spike and slab or “two group” priors that have some advantages in terms of model specification and computation while retaining many of the nice theoretical properties of the spike and slab priors. In this article, we consider computation for the linear model using local–global priors via blocked Gibbs sampling, which is currently the default choice for computation when the number of covariates exceeds the sample size. We focus in particular on the sampling of the local scales within a blocked Gibbs scheme. Our aim is to convey some challenges in implementation for the high‐dimensional setting and the various algorithmic innovations that we have employed to overcome them. These innovations convey the subtlety and delicacy of Bayesian computation for high‐dimensional, sparse models that rarely occur in lower dimensional problems and suggest problems that may be lurking within many implementations of MCMC for these models that can be nontrivial to detect. We focus on the horseshoe prior, which is the most popular and well characterized of the global–local priors, though we expect that many of our conclusions apply to other global–local priors.},

The proposed procedure adaptively collects time series with similar covariate values into an unknown number of groups and nonparametrically estimates group-specific power spectra through penalized splines. A fully Bayesian framework is developed in which the number of groups and the covariate partition defining the groups are random and fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. MultiCABS offers accurate estimation and inference on power spectra of multivariate time series with both smooth and abrupt dynamics across covariate by averaging over the distribution of covariate partitions. Performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods is evaluated in simulation studies. The proposed methodology is used to analyze the association between fear of falling and power spectra of center-of-pressure trajectories of postural control while standing in people with Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            Standard methods of spectral analysis are adapted to the interpretation of biomedical time series data with replication across subjects. The methodology is applied to two sets of data consisting of concentrations of luteinizing hormone in serial blood samples. For such data, the between-subject variability in periodogram ordinates at a given frequency is typically larger than would be implied by the usual asymptotic distribution theory for single series. We interpret this to mean that the underlying spectrum of the stochastic process representing the time variation in hormone concentration varies randomly between subjects. We describe simple random effects models to account for this extra variability and develop likelihood-based methods of inference, using a Monte Carlo integration method to evaluate the likelihood function. For our first data set, which comprises hormone concentrations in blood samples taken from eight subjects at 1 min intervals for 1 h, our model captures the qualitative behaviour of the between-subject variation in the spectrum. We conclude that there is a genuine high frequency component of variation in hormone concentrations and that the amplitude and frequency of this high frequency component vary between subjects. Our second data set relates to a similar sampling protocol, except that each subject is sampled before and after hormone replacement therapy. We conclude that this intervention has a significant effect on the spectrum.},

However, in almost all fMRI analyses, the time series elements of this data are assumed to be second‐order stationary. In this paper, we examine, using time series spectral methods, whether such stationary assumptions can be made and whether estimates of non‐stationarity can be used to gain understanding into fMRI experiments. A non‐stationary version of replicated stationary time series analysis is proposed that takes into account the replicated time series that are available from nearby voxels in a region of interest (ROI). These are used to investigate non‐stationarities in both the ROI itself and the variations within the ROI. The proposed techniques are applied to simulated data and to an anxiety‐inducing fMRI experiment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

              Objective
              The gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders is polysomnography, which generates extensive data about biophysical changes occurring during sleep. We developed the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), a comprehensive system for sharing sleep data. The NSRR embodies elements of a data commons aimed at accelerating research to address critical questions about the impact of sleep disorders on important health outcomes.
            
            
              Approach
              We used a metadata-guided approach, with a set of common sleep-specific terms enforcing uniform semantic interpretation of data elements across three main components: (1) annotated datasets; (2) user interfaces for accessing data; and (3) computational tools for the analysis of polysomnography recordings. We incorporated the process for managing dataset-specific data use agreements, evidence of Institutional Review Board review, and the corresponding access control in the NSRR web portal. The metadata-guided approach facilitates structural and semantic interoperability, ultimately leading to enhanced data reusability and scientific rigor.
            
            
              Results
              The authors curated and deposited retrospective data from 10 large, NIH-funded sleep cohort studies, including several from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, into the NSRR. The NSRR currently contains data on 26 808 subjects and 31 166 signal files in European Data Format. Launched in April 2014, over 3000 registered users have downloaded over 130 terabytes of data.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The NSRR offers a use case and an example for creating a full-fledged data commons. It provides a single point of access to analysis-ready physiological signals from polysomnography obtained from multiple sources, and a wide variety of clinical data to facilitate sleep research.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Many studies of biomedical time series signals aim to measure the association between frequency-domain properties of time series and clinical and behavioral covariates. However, the time-varying dynamics of these associations are largely ignored due to a lack of methods that can assess the changing nature of the relationship through time. This article introduces a method for the simultaneous and automatic analysis of the association between the time-varying power spectrum and covariates, which we refer to as conditional adaptive Bayesian spectrum analysis (CABS). The procedure adaptively partitions the grid of time and covariate values into an unknown number of approximately stationary blocks and nonparametrically estimates local spectra within blocks through penalized splines. CABS is formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, in which the number and locations of partition points are random, and fit using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Estimation and inference averaged over the distribution of partitions allows for the accurate analysis of spectra with both smooth and abrupt changes. The proposed methodology is used to analyze the association between the time-varying spectrum of heart rate variability and self-reported sleep quality in a study of older adults serving as the primary caregiver for their ill spouse.},

	abstract = {Spectral Analysis is one of the most important methods in signal processing. In practical application, it is critical to discuss the power spectral density estimation of finite data sampled from some stationary time series. A spectral estimator is expected to have good statistical properties such as consistency, high resolution and small variance. For one spectral estimation method, there exists a trade-off between high resolution and small variance. The paper provides a comparison of several popular spectral methods from both theoretical properties and practical applications. We first address several basic nonparametric methods, whose statistical characters are analysed. Then we explain the connections and differences between temporal windowing and lag windowing. Thereafter, the confidence intervals of both windows are given and used to evaluate the estimated results. Besides, several different parametric estimation methods of autoregressive time series are compared, and whose properties and effects are also introduced. Building on our understanding of these studies, we then apply parametric and nonparametric spectral estimation methods on the data of ocean surface wave height.},

            This paper introduces a flexible and adaptive nonparametric method for estimating the association between multiple covariates and power spectra of multiple time series. The proposed approach uses a Bayesian sum of trees model to capture complex dependencies and interactions between covariates and the power spectrum, which are often observed in studies of biomedical time series. Local power spectra corresponding to terminal nodes within trees are estimated nonparametrically using Bayesian penalized linear splines. The trees are considered to be random and fit using a Bayesian backfitting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that sequentially considers tree modifications via reversible-jump MCMC techniques. For high-dimensional covariates, a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet hyperprior on tree splitting proportions is considered, which provides sparse estimation of covariate effects and efficient variable selection. By averaging over the posterior distribution of trees, the proposed method can recover both smooth and abrupt changes in the power spectrum across multiple covariates. Empirical performance is evaluated via simulations to demonstrate the proposed method's ability to accurately recover complex relationships and interactions. The proposed methodology is used to study gait maturation in young children by evaluating age-related changes in power spectra of stride interval time series in the presence of other covariates.},

	abstract = {Background
The interaction between smoking and sleep seems appears to be bidirectional, but few studies evaluated the impact of smoking and its cessation on objective sleep parameters. In this context, this new study aimed to assess the impact of smoking and its cessation on sleep architecture and on ventilatory sleep parameters, particularly the presence of sleep apnea syndrome (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)≥15). Methods: Patients hospitalized for polysomnographic sleep exploration were compared according to their smoking status: active smokers (AS), former smokers (FS), non-smokers (NoNi). Psychiatric and non-psychiatric co-morbidities and treatment or substance use were taken into account in the analyses.
Results
A total of 170 participants were included (N = 37 FS, 39 AS, 86 NoNi). A significant decrease in the mean nocturnal O2 saturation was observed for FS and AS compared to NoNi. No differences were found regarding AHI. Regarding sleep architecture, we observed a significant decrease in the slow wave sleep duration for AS compared to NoNi, and interestingly not between FS and NoNi.
Conclusion
This study suggests that current smokers suffer from alterations in both sleep architecture and ventilatory parameters, the later appears to persist even after smoking cessation.},

            Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis is based on reported symptoms, which carries the potential risk of over- or under-diagnosis. A biological marker that helps to objectively define the disorder, providing information about its pathophysiology, is needed. A promising marker of cognitive states in humans is pupil size, which reflects the activity of an ‘arousal’ network, related to the norepinephrine system. We monitored pupil size from ADHD and control subjects, during a visuo-spatial working memory task. A sub group of ADHD children performed the task twice, with and without methylphenidate, a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Off-medication patients showed a decreased pupil diameter during the task. This difference was no longer present when patients were on-medication. Pupil size correlated with the subjects’ performance and reaction time variability, two vastly studied indicators of attention. Furthermore, this effect was modulated by medication. Through pupil size, we provide evidence of an involvement of the noradrenergic system during an attentional task. Our results suggest that pupil size could serve as a biomarker in ADHD.},

	abstract = {Abstract
              Systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability is increased and R-R interval variability is reduced in the elderly. Little is known, however, about how SBP and R-R interval variabilities change in the very elderly. More important, however, it is not known which frequency components of SBP and R-R interval variability are affected significantly. We addressed this issue in subjects older than 70 years by broadband spectral analysis, which allows all variability components from the lowest to the highest frequency to be considered. In 20 very elderly normotensive subjects (mean±SD age, 78.1±6.8 years) and 28 normotensive adult subjects (36.1±7.1 years), noninvasive finger blood pressure and R-R intervals were recorded continuously for 30 minutes in the supine position and 15 minutes in the upright position. SBP and R-R interval power spectral densities were computed over the entire frequency region between 0.005 Hz (0.007 Hz in the upright position) and 0.5 Hz. Overall SBP variability (SD) was greater and overall R-R interval variability was less in very old subjects than in adult subjects. All spectral R-R interval powers were reduced significantly in very elderly individuals. The spectral SBP powers were greater in the very elderly group than in the adult group only in the very-low-frequency range ({\textless}0.04 Hz). This was true in the supine and the standing positions. With subjects in the standing position, the shape of the broadband spectra differed in the very old and adult subjects because in the former group the increase in SBP and R-R interval power around 0.1 Hz that was seen in the latter was blunted. Therefore, in very elderly subjects a reduction in overall R-R interval variability is accounted for by a reduction in all of its frequency components. The accompanying increase in overall BP variability, however, results from a nonhomogeneous behavior of its frequency components, which consists of an increase in the very low frequency and a concomitant reduction in the higher frequency powers. The mechanisms responsible for these changes may be complex, but at least they may in part reflect the baroreflex impairment and autonomic dysfunction that characterize aging.},

	abstract = {The power spectrum of biomedical time series provides important indirect measurements of physiological processes underlying health and biological functions. However, simultaneously characterizing power spectra for multiple time series remains challenging due to extra spectral variability and varying time series lengths. We propose a method for hierarchical Bayesian estimation of stationary time series (HBEST) that provides an interpretable framework for efficiently modeling multiple power spectra. HBEST models log power spectra using a truncated cosine basis expansion with a novel global-local coefficient decomposition, enabling simultaneous estimation of population-level and individual-level power spectra and accommodating time series of varying lengths. The fully Bayesian framework provides shrinkage priors for regularized estimation and efficient information sharing. Simulations demonstrate HBEST's advantages over competing methods in computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. An application to heart rate variability time series demonstrates HBEST's ability to accurately characterize power spectra and capture associations with traditional cardiovascular risk factors.},
