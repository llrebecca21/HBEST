# Generate Conditionally Independent `R`-Many MA(4) Varying Time Series of the Same Length (Version 2)

`generate_MA4_varyType2()` generates `R`-many time series where the
MA(4) that is used as the base coefficients for the variation is
`(-.3,-.6,-.3,.6)`. In this version of the data generation, only the
first coefficient is changed, all other coefficients are left as is.
This is based on the MA(4) used in Granados-Garcia et al. (2022) . This
is the data generation that is used in Lee et al. (2025) .

## Usage

``` r
generate_MA4_varyType2(n, R = 1, burn = 50, alpha = 0.05)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  A numeric vector that determines the length of the time series
  generated. Must contain `R`-many entries. Time series may be of
  different lengths.

- R:

  An optional scalar indicating the number of conditionally independent
  time series to be generated. (default is `1`).

- burn:

  An optional scalar indicating the amount of burn-in to be used with
  [`stats::arima.sim()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/arima.sim.html).
  (default is `50`).

- alpha:

  An optional scalar specifying the variation wanted from the first base
  coefficient. (default is `0.05`).

## Value

The function returns a list containing:

|              |                                                                                                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ts_list`    | returns an `R`-long list each containing an `(n[r]` \\\times\\ `1)` matrix of the generated time series. |
| `true_theta` | returns a `(4` \\\times\\ `R)` matrix of true generated MA(4) coefficients.                              |

## Details

The variation around the first base theta coefficient is generated by:

1.  Sample 1 value from a \\N(0,1)\\ to use as a "mean".

2.  Calculate: `basetheta[1] + alpha * mu_r * abs(basetheta[1])` where
    `basetheta[1]` is the original first MA(4) coefficient; `mu_r` is
    the 1 sampled values from the \\N(0,1)\\; and `alpha` is the
    user-specified scalar that controls the variation around the first
    base coefficient.

3.  Generate: A new time-series using the new `theta` value from step 2.

4.  Repeat steps 1-3 `R`-many times.

## Examples

``` r
R <- 20
## For time series of different lengths:
n <- c(rep(500, R / 2), rep(800, R / 2))
burn <- 50
alpha <- 0.05
ts <- generate_MA4_varyType2(n = n, R = R, burn = burn, alpha = alpha)$ts_list

# plot the time series generated:
# create an empty plot
plot(
  x = c(), y = c(),
  xlim = c(0, 800),
  ylim = range(ts),
  main = "Example",
  ylab = "",
  xlab = "time"
)
for (r in 1:10) {
  lines(ts[[r]][, 1], col = "blue")
}
for (r in 11:R) {
  lines(ts[[r]][, 1], col = "red")
}


## Returns an R-long list object each with a (500 x 1) matrix object,
## a (4 x 20) matrix of true MA(4) coefficients,
## a scalar returning the alpha provided,
## and a (4 x 20) matrix of the standard normal values generated for each R.
```
